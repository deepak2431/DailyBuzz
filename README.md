<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> :pencil: About The Project</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
  DailyBuzz is an app built with React.js library which displays the top news from different countries to the users. User can also select different categories of news to read. <a href="https://newsapi.org/" target="_blank">NEWS API </a> has been used to fetch the news of user desired interests.
</p>

<!-- How I worked -->
<h2 id="how-I-worked">How I worked? </h2>
<ul>
  <li>My goal of the project was to work on a React App which would includes data fetching from any API's, state management, dynamic routing and implement few JavaScript functions. So, I developed this app to brush my skills by implementing those stuffs.</li>
  <li>I have used Agile methodology to complete the whole application. I developed each segment and features of the app in small increments by implementing one thing and once and making sure it works perfectly.</li>
  <li>The design inspiration was taken from some news site as TechCrunch.</li>
  <li>I have used Github issues for managing the tasks to be completed and on which I was working on.</li>
</ul>

<!-- How I developed -->
<h2 id="how-I-develop">How I built this project? </h2>
<ul>
  <li>I have used React.js frontend library for development of this app.</li>
  <li>Materialize CSS Framework along with some custom CSS has been used for designing the UI of the app.</li>
  <li>I have used just <code>useState</code> hook to handle all sort of state management.</li>
  <li>Axios has been used to fetch the data from the API.</li>
  <li>Search features has been implemented using the JavaScript filter method.</li>
  <li>Pagination has been implemented using <code>react-paginate</code> module.</li>
</ul>

<!-- How I developed -->
<h2 id="other-features">What other features and improvements could be done? </h2>
